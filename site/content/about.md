# What are we?

We're a site about sharing some of those stories that only like minded production support people would understand. Those moments when you're debugging applications and there's a point why you just can't explain not only why something is happening, but WHAT THE FUCK is actually happening.

You're welcome to share any and all stories here, just submit a PR!
